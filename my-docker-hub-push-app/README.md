# My Docker Hub Push App

This project provides a GitHub Action workflow to automate the process of building and pushing Docker images to Docker Hub.

## Getting Started

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-docker-hub-push-app.git
   cd my-docker-hub-push-app
   ```

2. **Configure Docker Hub credentials:**

   Ensure you have your Docker Hub username and access token ready. You will need to set these as secrets in your GitHub repository:

   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKER_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

3. **Modify the Dockerfile:**

   Customize the `Dockerfile` as needed for your application. This file defines how your Docker image will be built.

4. **Push changes to the main branch:**

   Once you have made your changes, push them to the `main` branch of your repository. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/docker_hub_push.yml`.

## Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow performs the following steps:

- Checks out the code from the repository.
- Logs into Docker Hub using the provided credentials.
- Builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
- Pushes the built image to the specified Docker Hub repository.
